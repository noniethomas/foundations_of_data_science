# foundations_of_data_science
Final project from Foundations of Data Science course at Columbia University (taught by Professor Clifford Stein).

I used a Kaggle data set, which had information on every known homicide in the United States from 1980 to 2014. Generally, I explored the relationships between homicide and race in 2014 through some specific guiding questions and using statistical methods. This topic was motivated by an ethnic studies course, from which I leaned about the manifestations of systemic and institutional racism in crime and the criminal justice system in the United States.
